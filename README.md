## 👋 Hi there, I'm Neutrino!

I'm the **CEO & Founder of [BeaverX](https://beaverx.ai)** — an AI-powered portfolio assistant that helps users manage gold, stocks, crypto, and more, all with privacy at its core.  

I also write about software architecture, AI systems, and dev workflows at **[ezidev.tech](https://ezidev.tech)**.  
Most days you'll find me building, breaking, and rebuilding things that connect data, intelligence, and good design. ⚙️🚀
